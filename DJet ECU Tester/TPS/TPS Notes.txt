TPS full throttle E2-TPS
  10V, 5.1k resistor
  I = V/R = 10 / 5.1 = 1.96mA
  switch connects to ground
  When not at full throttle, line is pulled to 10V
  
TPS acceleration contact 1 E9-TPS
TPS acceleration contact 2 E20-TPS
  I = V/R = 12 / (1.8+10) = 1mA
  signals take turns to go to ground as accelerator is pressed
  10 fingers per signal for acceleration
  floating/no connection when releasing accelerator

TPS idle contact E17-TPS
  10V, 22k resistor
  I = V/R = 10 / 22 = 0.4mA
  When throttle is closed switch is closed (0 Ohms)
  When throttle is open more than 2 deg switch is open
